This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) UI.

This project is able to call AJAX requests to create, update and edit on a [server using Express](https://github.com/sbunciak/express-crud-sample). The server's index.js file has been, however, edited (new file can be found [here](https://github.com/PSilling/thesis-portal-hw/tree/master/src/server)) to sort topic IDs after removal.

To use install the dependencies, launch the server and then the application.
